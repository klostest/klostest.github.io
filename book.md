Find it on Amazon: _[Data Science Projects with Python: A case study approach to successful data science projects using Python, pandas, and scikit-learn](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Projects-Python-scikit-learn-dp-1838551026/dp/1838551026/)_

There are a lot of great data science and machine learning books out there. But most of them don't discuss what it's actually like to be a data scientist. What challenges will you face day-to-day? How do you make sure that your work will be useful to stakeholders? This book presents an end-to-end data science project as it may be encountered in a professional setting.

In this book, you will learn how to explore data and create compelling visualizations, using Python and its rich set of open-source data science packages. There are also deep dives in to foundational modeling techniques. You'll develop a thorough understanding of the logistic regression and random forest classification methods. By the end, you'll see how a data science project lifecycle works, and know what you need to do along the way to make sure the project succeeds:

- What are the circumstances under which data may come to you?
- How do you communicate with the client who depends on your services?
- How can you demonstrate the business value that your model creates?

The book is aimed at business analysts and other aspiring data scientists. To get the most out of it, you should be comfortable with math and statistics, and familiar with the basic constructs of computer programming in any language. The fundamentals of Python are introduced as necessary.

I hope you find this book helpful on your journey to becoming a data scientist.
