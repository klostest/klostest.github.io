Find it on Amazon: _[Data Science Projects with Python: A case study approach to successful data science projects using Python, pandas, and scikit-learn](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Projects-Python-scikit-learn-dp-1838551026/dp/1838551026/)_

There are a lot of great data science and machine learning books out there. But most of them don't discuss what it's actually like to be a data scientist. What challenges will you face day-to-day? How do you make sure that your work will be useful to stakeholders? This book presents an end-to-end data science project as it may be encountered in a professional setting.

In this book, you will learn how to explore data and create compelling visualizations, using Python and its rich set of open-source data science packages. There are also deep dives in to foundational modeling techniques. You'll develop a thorough understanding of the machine learning classification methods of logistic regression and random forest that you can use to develop a predictive model. Throughout all of this, you'll see how a data science project lifecycle works, and what you need to do along the way to make sure the project succeeds:

- What are the circumstances under which data may come to you?
- How do you communicate with the client who depends on your services?
- How can you demonstrate the business value that your model creates?

I hope you find this book helpful on your journey to becoming a data scientist. Please let me know if you spot any errors, have a question, or other feedback. I'll add them to this page as appropriate.
